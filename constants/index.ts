      "Hats off to Borderline Travel and Tours! I highly recommend their services. I had an incident that I wasn't able to purchase a last minute travel issurance for my fiance and immigration wouldn't let her thru until she had one. With clock winding down and 10 mins to past boarding call. Borderline travel and tours came thru for me and got the necessary documents processed. She is on her way here to the United States where we can finally get married after 2 years of not seeing each other due to covid restrictions on travel. All this made possible thru the efforts of Borderline! I recommend 10 out of 10 stars. Thank you so much !!",

Our hotel was very good, food was excellent (now I know that I like Korean food) and the tour guide, Jenny, was very knowledgeable, engaging and has a healthy sense of humor. Martin, the assistant tour guide and photographer was always very helpful and Mr. Kim, our driver, was very careful. Ma'am Joy was very hands-on and always ready to help us out in our predicaments. Her personal touch can be seen in her handling of our study tour. Thank you very much, Borderline Travel and Tours!",
